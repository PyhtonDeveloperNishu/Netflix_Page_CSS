## [Hosted Link](https://pyhtondevelopernishu.github.io/Netflix_Page_CSS/)

This project demonstrates a Netflix-inspired landing page with a **black transparent overlay** on a full-screen background image. The overlay creates a visually appealing effect while keeping the content easily readable.

## Features
- **Background Image with Overlay**: A full-screen background image with a black transparent overlay for enhanced readability.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Stylish Header**: Includes a logo placeholder and buttons for "Sign In" and "Sign Up" with a modern design.
- **Centered Content**: Main content (heading and paragraph) is centered and styled for visibility.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: For styling, including background image, overlay, buttons, and layout.

## How It Works
1. A background image is applied to a `div` container with CSS.
2. A black transparent overlay is created using the `::before` pseudo-element and `rgba` for opacity.
3. Content is placed above the overlay using `z-index` for proper layering.
4. Buttons are styled for a clean and consistent design.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PyhtonDeveloperNishu/Netflix_Page_CSS.git
